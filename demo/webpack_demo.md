Webpack is a front-end build systems like Grunt and Gulp.

After having webpack.config.js, you can invoke Webpack without any arguments.

Some command-line options you should know.

- webpack – for building once for development
- webpack -p – for building once for production (minification)
- webpack --watch – for continuous incremental build
- webpack -d – to include source maps
- webpack --colors – for making things pretty
